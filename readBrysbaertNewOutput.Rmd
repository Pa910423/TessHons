```

Get proper filename with path

```{r}
myPath<- "."
dataFileName<- "BrysbaertNew2009_3ltrWords.txt"
fileWithPath<- file.path(myPath,dataFileName)
#dir(myPath)
file.exists(fileWithPath)
```

Example reading in that one file
```{r}
library('readr')#install.packages('readr')
df <-read_tsv(fileWithPath)  #read_tsv from tidyverse readr has advantage of not having padding spaces
#in subject and another column
head(df)
```

Delete extra empty column, that was filled in by readr as "X11"
```{r}
df$X11<-NULL

```
