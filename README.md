* Turn off the sound with boolean flag.
It doesn't seem to like portaudio, has error closing it. But there is no sound anyway because by default the computers have no sound. And we probably don't have enough headphones, and then would have to unmute the sound. So add a sound flag and turn off sound. That might also fix the ungraceful quit.
