<h1>Understanding PRESBYCUSIS</h1>

<i>Presbycusis</i>, from Greek presbys “elder” + akousis “hearing”, is age-related hearing loss.
Let's start with the hearing of your average 20-year-old.
<div style="clear: left;" >
<img SRC="images/ThresholdFrequencyDbAnnotatedAlex.png" HEIGHT=400> 
</div>
The curve shows the quietest sounds (technically, the threshold sound intensity) a healthy 20-year-old can hear. For frequencies above 15000 Hz, threshold gets worse very rapidly.

    <BR><BR><BR>This graph shows average sensitivity at each frequency for different age groups. <BR><BR>The dependent variable expresses sensitivity <emphasis>relative</emphasis> to a healthy 20-year-old, which means taking the previous graph's curve and flattening it out into a flat line across frequencies.
For each age, you see that the hearing loss is much worse for high frequencies than for low frequencies.</p>
</div> <!--for image with text next to it-->
 <div style="clear: left;  padding-bottom: 12px;">  <!--Just to break to next line after image-->
If we play a sound at a higher and higher frequency, we can find the limit of your hearing for that sound pressure level- the frequency at which your threshold is above that sound pressure level.

	step="1" value="200" onchange="sample.changeFrequency(this.value);">
	<BR>
</div> <!-- end content-->

<button onclick="sample.toggle()">Play/pause</button> 
Press play, then 
slide the frequency back and forth. Notice the highest frequency you can hear.

This self-test is only an illustration; a proper test would also require a very quiet room and a calibrated computer-headphone combination.<BR>

     The accumulation of loud noise takes a toll on your hearing, exacerbating presbycusis.
     <BR><BR>    Studies of Easter Islanders and other peoples living away from industrialised society suggests that they suffer less hearing loss; unless they come live with us!

  Maybe you should consider wearing earplugs the next time you go to a loud club or concert...

<BR>
Some years ago, Mr. Howard Stapleton, of Barry, Wales, was annoyed by the young ruffians loitering outside a local corner shop. Stapleton knew something about hearing, and realized that playing a sufficiently high-frequency sound outside the shop would be maddening for the kids, but inaudible - or nearly inaudible - to older customers.

He tested various frequencies on himself and his children and decided on 17,600 Hz.
Using the slider above, try it out.
<!--- Definitely doesn't seem to play 17,600 Hz, must be lower than that

<P>
Even with ears that are 19 years old (and I do mean old, as 19 is not young for the industrialised inner ear) you may be able to hear the sound, particularly if you crank up the volume (not recommended for extended intervals!). As you get older, the SPL you require to hear this frequency steadily increases-
review the <a href="#ageGraph">hearing loss and age graph</a> at top.
<P>
Some ingenious schoolkids have turned this idea on its head and there are now ringtones available that play at 17,000 Hz - the better to use your mobile phone at school without your teacher knowing!

Differences in frequency sensitivity are also exploited in other technologies. Dogs are sensitive to frequencies much higher than humans are. The sensitivity of various species normalized so that threshold at the species' best frequency is 0 is plotted at the right, from

A great tit is a small songbird, with an inner ear structure similar to that of dinosaurs.

 <A HREF="http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/brachio/extras.html#gsc.tab=0">Brachiosauruses</A> were enormous. Their inner ears were very large, allowing them to hear ultra-low frequencies.

Dogs are better at ultra-high frequencies. Some dog whistles  emit frequencies within the range of canines' ears, but too high for humans.

So you can get your dog's attention (or annoy him, at the very least) without hurting your own ears.

ACOUSTIC REFLEX- SHOW A GRAPH OF IT, EXPLAIN THE VOCALIZATION ONE AND ITS NEURAL PATHWAY
acoustic reflex relaxes after how many minutes? 
Exposure to loud music at clubs and concerts or in one's earphones hastens your hearing loss.
